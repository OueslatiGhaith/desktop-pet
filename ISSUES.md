## features
    - [x] animation states that move across the screen
    - [ ] screen edge detection (to prevent walking off-screen) (seems to be impossible currently, as there is no possible way to get information about the current monitor or it's current size/resolution, the best that can be done is to randomly change direction of the sprite)

## bugs
    - [x] intially the windows does take the correct scale and position, this is solved after the first state transition
